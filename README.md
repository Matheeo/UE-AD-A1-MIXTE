## Setup

### Prerequisites

Before running the services, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)
- Virtualenv (Optional, for isolated environments)

# Running the Services

The easiest way to launch both the gRPC and GraphQL services is to use the provided `start-services.sh` script.

1. Make the `start-services.sh` script executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x start-services.sh
    ```

2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    ./start-services.sh
    ```
